## My secret to being one of the best learners in my university

### “In learning you will teach and in teaching you will learn”

Well yeah, I never like boasting, but there is one thing I am proud of — I used this amazing technique while I was in my college and the result? I was the rank holder for all four years, and with my help, many other students learnt a lot. After all, we rise by lifting others, don’t we?

Ever thought how learning can be made quick and fun? Well if you already didn’t think about this then let me share a secret that I have been following over the years — “The Feynman Technique”.

The principle behind this method is : ***“The Teacher Learns The Most”.***

Teaching others what you have to learn is the magical trick that will make you an expert at the selected topic.

Without wasting any more time let’s get started and learn how we can implement and incorporate this technique in our lives.

Also, thanks for reading this, since while teaching you this technique, I will get more better at this technique, after all, the teacher learns the most!

## The Feynman Technique

I’m sure you all must be very inquisitive to know what was the thought that led to development of this technique and how Feynman became the pioneer of this highly efficient method.

So it all dates back to my favorite subject Physics. The concepts of Particle Physics was complex and difficult to understand. Prior to Feynman’s diagrams explaining the essentials of this, (that made him win a Nobel for the same) people found it very difficult to understand the concepts.

What seemed impossible, unachievable was made easy by his diagram. This was the power of the technique he developed.

We can implement this amazing technique using these four simple steps -

### Step 1: Decide And Study The Topic Of Your Choice

As the title says, decide the topic/subject/concept you wish to master, and take note of all the information you have on that topic. Later, as you come across more information on that topic, add that on too.

### Step 2: **Pretend To Explain That Concept To A 6 Year Old Child**

After deciding the subject/concept, the next step is to pretend that you are teaching that concept to a 6 year old child who has no prior information about the topic.

Trust me, if you can teach a concept to a 6 year child then you can be called a master at that topic. How?

 1. You must be very **clear** in what facts you want to convey

 2. You must also make sure that whatever you convey is **easy to comprehend.**

If you can teach the concept to a layman, it shows that you have the mastery over that concept. (Keep what you wanna convey **concise** and avoid unnecessary information.)

### **Step 3: Identify And Remove Gaps**

No one is born a perfectionist but we can strive to attain perfection in certain things. So when you will start implementing this technique you will face hurdles along the way but you have to be persistent and never give up.

It’s highly likely that you might not be able to deliver the facts clearly at start. So, **mark the gaps** you take while teaching the concept.
> # A gap is nothing but a pause or a **knowledge halt** you incur while demonstration.

Once you have noted down these gaps, try filling these gaps and eliminating them.

With practice and good reference of books you can increase your knowledge and have a thorough understanding that will help in avoiding these gaps. In this process you definitely can grow and learn tremendously.

### Step 4: **Simplify Your Teaching**

I bet you might be one of those who like to cover most of the syllabus one night before the exam by watching YouTube videos. But have you noticed something whenever you do that?

You prefer watching the videos of those content creators who are more clear in their delivery and make concepts easier to comprehend over those who over-complicate the subject and are not clear while demonstrating those concepts.
>  In Feynman’s own words, “In order to talk to each other, we have to have words, and that’s all right. It’s a good idea to try to see the difference, and it’s a good idea to know when we are teaching the tools of science, such as words, and when we are teaching science itself.”

Thus it is very important that we break the entire concept into small easy to understand concepts. I call it “the process of chunking”, or in simple words, dividing the concept into easily understandable chunks.

Simplification of the concept is one of the key ways by which we can make the entire technique useful and impactful.

Thus, rather than conveying the complex concepts it is important that we first understand what is being said, then write it down in our words. Only then we can convey this simplified version to others and truly learn the concept/theory.

## Story Telling : How I Follow Feynman’s Technique

All of us are beautiful and creative individuals and there can be a lot of ways by which you can follow this technique. I am going to tell you a method which I follow and love ~ “*Story Telling*”
>  ***Once you make your audience connect with you, you have achieved it!***

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3174/0*39nuy0BSF-DUQuty.png)

The essence is that you can accumulate parts of the information and join them to form a story that incorporates all the relevant information about the chosen topic. This is how you can convert the otherwise boring data into valuable information.
> # Art by which you can make sense out of a large pool of facts, and that too in a fun way, makes a good story

This technique has helped me greatly and transformed me into a more creative person. It has also made the entire process interesting while enabling greater retention power. But, how did I realize this?

I have this talent of memorizing the lyrics of songs pretty fast (and I am proud of it), and I noticed that if I was told any story which I could relate to and was easy to understand, I would remember it for longer time as compared to the plain information or the “raw data”

This is what encouraged me to use storytelling as an effective tool for applying the Feynman technique! And now, I write blogs and speak in educational events and webinars every week, and each time, I try to present to you a story that you can remember for a long time.

I am super proud of the fact that I have reached more than 15,000 students through more than 15 initiatives, 100+ blogs and by speaking in 50+ events/webinars.

And, what did I get in return? More knowledge. Let me remind you, “The teacher learns the most”.

## Here’s my challenge for you

If this blog could inspire you, take this challenge of spreading knowledge through any form, LinkedIn posts, blogs, mentoring your juniors, etc. After some time, you will see the results of this technique automatically!

Do let me know your innovative way in which you are going to follow this technique in the comments section. Would love to read and learn from all of them :)

That’s it, I hope you liked the article. I wish all of you a happy and peaceful life. Enjoy your weekend.
