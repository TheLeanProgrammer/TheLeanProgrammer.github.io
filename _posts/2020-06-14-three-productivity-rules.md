## Three essential productivity rules that most people aren’t following.

### Productivity does not ask you to do everything, neither does it tell you to do nothing

Productivity is a trend these days. Especially during the lockdown period, “productivity” has become a buzz word, and people are blindly taking part in this race even without knowing anything about it.

Yes, they think that they are being productive, but are they actually being productive, or is it just a social media show off?

As I wrote above, productivity never demands you to go out and take on every challenge the world has to offer, that’s just foolish. Being productive has much more to do with being efficient on how you utilize time.

While some people are being productive, some are displaying themselves to be productive, and some being more lazy then ever, I am going to tell you three tips which can make you more efficient.

## 1. Less doesn’t mean lazy, busy doesn’t mean productive

Probably this is not something you are hearing for the first time, but are you actually following it?

Are you one of those who take on any work that’s given to you just to make an impression on your mind that you are being productive?

Productivity is the opposite of that. The idea is to do less meaningless work so that you can focus more on the things that actually matter.

Let’s take a simple example, a friend of mine, “Jimmy” is sending emails to his subscribers manually. It took him a day to do so, and he is very happy, his day was very productive.

Another friend of mine, “John”, is using an email automation tool to do so, and it takes him 30 mins to get everything done. He spends the rest of his day planning for his future ventures and spends time with his family.

Whom do you think is more productive?
> # It’s essential to remember that productivity is more about efficiency, it’s about spending less time on things that don’t matter and more time on things of greater importance.

### What to do?

 1. Realize your long term goals

 2. Make sure your daily tasks align with your long term goals.

 3. Even if the work you are doing currently is not aligning with your long term goals, find out 30 minutes daily to spend on the tasks of greater importance, which move you closer to your long term goals

Always remember that doing less might not always mean laziness, and doing more might not always mean being productive.

## 2. There’s no right time to do the wrong thing, and there’s no wrong time to do the right thing

We all look for that “perfect time” to start something new, don’t we? but the sad truth is that time will never be perfect enough to keep you in your comfort zone and fulfill your dreams.

Waiting for a perfect opportunity? It will never come until you start working for one.

The world works this way, it’s not like the world is conspiring against you, it’s just that the world will never go out of it’s way to bring to you some “Magic Moment”

My experience tells me that if we are just going to wait for this one *“Magic Moment”, *we are doomed to get disappointed. There is no such thing as a magic moment.
> # Growth is a continuous process, enjoy the journey!

Growth happens slowly, and gradually over a period of time that depends on person to person. Go and check the story of every person who is right now living the life that you dream of, none of them became successful suddenly!

The idea is to take the first step towards your goal and keep walking, no matter how small the steps might.

## 3. Ask for Forgiveness, Not Permission.

Going forward from the previous point, the idea is to take first step forward, and it’s usually better to take the risk if it’s calculated.

Most people fear uncertainty more than mediocrity. You want to take some risk and start something new, you might feel family restrictions, society pressure, and what not.

In any case, if you have calculated the risks, and if it isn’t doing any harm to anyone else, it’s always better to take your chance and just do it instead of taking approvals from others.

I don’t advice you to go out and just do all mischievous activities and then asking sorry for them.

The point I want to convey here is that if the risks are calculated, low, and the loss is reversible, then just go ahead and do it, don’t seek for approval, don’t give people the chance to say no.

> # If it’s a good idea, go ahead and do it. It is much easier to apologize than it is to get permission.

Summarizing the above mentioned tips, productivity is not only about how much work you, but also about how you plan your time. So always remember these three points -

 1. Less doesn’t mean lazy, busy doesn’t mean productive

 2. There’s no right time to do the wrong thing, 
and there’s no wrong time to do the right thing.

 3. Ask for Forgiveness, Not Permission.

Have a vision in life, and align your daily goals towards your greater vision.
