## This story changed the way I used to look at critics.

### No matter what you do, there will be people who will dislike you for no reason. Then, what’s the solution?

Handling criticism is quite a trending topic, and it will always remain. We all face criticism in our lives, some times, they help us grow, and some times, it feels like the other person is just displaying his personal hatred in the form of useless criticism.

There’s a major difference between constructive criticism, and negative criticism.

Constructive criticism is very important for personal growth and development. One thing that we all should be following is a “quick feedback mechanism”. Well, what’s that? Let’s have a look at that after the story :)

## The Saint and the Kids…

The whole idea behind handling hate is to not bother yourself. If it has no scope of improving you and if it’s clearly senseless, that’s not feedback or criticism, that’s hate.

The solution is to stop taking things personally, and letting it go.

Yeah, I know that you must have heard this a lot of times, but still it seems a little difficult to follow, right? Let’s look at how can we achieve this type of Nirvana.

Let me tell you a small story, once upon a time, a group of children were trying to get some fruits from a tree by throwing some stones at it. There was a saint sitting under that tree who got hit by a stone.

The saint became angry, and said that “I curse you….”, the kids interrupted him and said, “Please forgive us, it was by mistake”, but then suddenly one of those kids said something really interesting.

He said that, “Respected saint, a tree, when hit by stones, gives fruits, and you mister saint, when hit by stone, give curse? I guess we should worship the tree”

The saint was in a state of confusion and deep thought, and so was I, haha

We generally have a defensive attitude towards criticism, I am no exception

But (over) thinking about this story, there should be a different way to handle criticism. I know it’s a difficult thing, but not impossible.

No matter what you do, there will be people who will dislike you for no reason. Then, what’s the solution?

I have a two step solution for you, the first one to not take the things personally, and the second one to grow and learn from criticism. Try to implement both.

## Step 1: Learning the art of not giving a “f”

First step to achieve peace of mind? Don’t take things too personally, let it go.

Sounds pretty easy, but almost impossible to implement while in the heat of things, isn’t it? Well here are the steps that might help you -

 1. Take a step back, turn off your internet and relax for 5–10 mins.

 2. Listen to the other person, try to understand, he might be saying something useful?

 3. Have Empathy, maybe the other person was actually thinking good about you

 4. Try not to get too defensive, don’t end up wasting your time

 5. No matter if you are correct or wrong, end the conversation by saying “Thanks for help, god bless you”, this is much better than wasting your time.

Do try these steps next time, and tell me if how it goes :)

## Step 2: Mastering the “Quick Feedback Mechanism”

We all know the importance of feedback, no matter if it’s your personal life, or professional, or it’s your brand, we have to look for feedback to continuously improve ourselves.

Let me explain my “Quick feedback mechanism” very quickly.

<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/l0HlTuxPt7db6X38s" width="360" height="202" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe>

I divide feedbacks into 3 categories,

 1. Positive Feedback

 2. Negative Feedback

 3. Useless Feedback

Feedback is an integral part of our learning, and without feedback, we might never improve. Have a growth mindset, try to see how can you learn and grow from each feedback you get.

Let’s see these 3 kinds of feedback, and after that I’ll summarize you about my “quick feedback mechanism”

### 1. The Positive Feedback

I categorize **Positive Feedback** as the rewards which we get for our good performance. For example, when you were a kid, your parents might have bribed you to get that favorite sports equipment of yours if you pass the exams.

This type of feedback can help us a lot to get out of our comfort zones and get started. It gives us that initial push to start doing things.

But, the problem with this feedback is that it doesn’t help us in the long term, not every time you will get rewards, plus, if it goes for a very long time, you might even start losing the intrinsic motivation to do things. You will start expecting rewards every time you do somethings.

So yeah, use this kind of feedback mechanism to get started, reward yourself each time you push your limits, each time you go outside your comfort zone. (But don’t make it a habit)

### 2. The Negative Feedback

The constructive criticism falls under this category.

It’s impossible to be 100% correct always, and it’s good to look for ways to improve. When people give you this feedback which is actually a flaw at your end, you get the chance to improve it.
> # While the positive feedback is important to get started, the negative feedback is important to become an expert!

Think about it, you are just starting and people start criticizing you, it might be demotivating, so look for positive feedback (reward yourself) at the beginning.

Similarly, once you have a good command over the things you do, at that time as well if you only get the positive feedback, you will never know where are you lacking.

Both the types of feedback can act as a blessing or a curse depending on the timing. Therefore, once you think you are good enough at a particular thing, start looking for constructive feedback, and aim to be an expert instead of just being “average good”.

### 3. The useless feedback

On your journey of personal development, you will come across many types of people, and the most annoying ones are of two kinds,

 1. Who will say something just for the sake of saying

 2. Who will hate you no matter what you do

For the first category, it’s relatively easier to just nod and carry on.

For the second one, you will have to learn to differentiate between constructive criticism and useless criticism. Once you find that the person is criticizing you just for the sake of it, try to ignore him, don’t take it too personally (see the above steps), and try maintaining a distance.

And we are finally here,

### The Quick Feedback Mechanism

I always suggest people to understand these three types of feedback, and follow this simple mechanism,

 1. Look for a mentor

 2. Look for a group of like-minded people

 3. Keep learning, exploring and doing

 4. After completing your task, ask for a quick feedback from your mentor.

 5. Share your learning with the group of people, listen to their advice

 6. In the beginning, to get over that threshold motivation, reward yourself when you do something good (the positive feedback)

 7. Once you achieve a good level of experience, start looking for negative feedback, and improve yourself

 8. Ignore all the useless feedback (Don’t get stuck on things that are meant to waste your time).
