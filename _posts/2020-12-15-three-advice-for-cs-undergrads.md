## 3 Pieces Of Advice For Computer Science Undergrads

### Aspiring Software Developers, don’t ignore this!

College life is a blessing, while we are in it, we rarely think that the college days would ever get over, but the sad fact is, 3–4 years pass by very quickly.

While you are still in college, it’s important to have fun, make friends and enjoy, those days are never going to come back. But, it’s also important to start thinking about your future and taking action.

So in this blog, I am going to tell you 3 things that you should absolutely think about while you are still in college. This blog isn’t a list of things that you should do while you are in college, I have a full 1-hour YouTube video on that, this blog just focuses on 3 simple tips that you should keep in mind if you are a CS student.

## 1. Don’t fall for rumors

Computer science is one field full of rumors, and I bet you might have come across many. The bad thing about these rumors is that they make us confused about the decisions we take.

Let’s have a look at a few which I used to hear while I was in college -

* You can’t get a job without doing competitive programming

* Web development is being automated, don’t go for it

* Programmers are nerds

* Data Science is only for people who are good in Mathematics

* Learn Blockchain, it is the future

* You won’t get a job if you don’t learn Machine Learning

* ML/AI will kill all SDE jobs

* PHP is dead

And many more (which make me laugh now when I think about them)

### **How does it make a difference and how to deal with it?**

Although every rumor has some story associated with it and some truth from which it is formed, but making your decisions and forming biases based on these rumors can prove to be disastrous for your future and career.

You wouldn’t give up on eating or having dinner just because someone starts a rumor that eating “dinner” makes you fat. Would you?

Although there might be some truth associated with it, overeating at night time might increase your body fat, but that doesn’t mean you should stop eating dinner.

Similarly, in the computer science rumors that you keep hearing, there would always be a back-story with some truth. So, instead of believing in the rumors and taking an irrational decision, try to find that story from where the rumor associated, analyze the scenario, and then take decisions.

Here are some simple steps:

 1. When you hear a rumor from someone, ask them where did they hear it from

 2. Double-check the sources

 3. Ask Google and follow the latest news

 4. Follow thought leaders in the domain you are interested in (they generally share updates and latest trends about the industry)

 5. Measure “how much it affects you”

 6. Then, take the decision.

### Let’s take an example

Let’s consider the most popular rumor “PHP is dead”.

If you see the industry, [there are still a lot of jobs for PHP](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/php-developer-jobs/) and WordPress devs, but in recent times we have seen a huge shift from legacy technologies to modern languages, we have seen immense growth in the number of jobs for React developers, Node developers, etc. and those are often high paying.

So, saying that “PHP is dead” would be completely wrong, but saying that “Modern languages are slowly monopolizing the industry” wouldn’t be wrong.

Now if you are a PHP developer, instead of listening to these rumors and giving up on the language which you have spent so much time to learn, you can do this —

 1. Find out a job/Continue your current job to monetize your skills in PHP

 2. Accept the fact that new/modern languages are here

 3. Look at the trends to find out which skill is beneficial for you

 4. Start learning it side by side

Now this will make you ready for the transition if you want to.

Hope this example made sense, and from now you will dig deep, make rational decisions, and won’t waste too much time in confusion whenever you hear any rumor.

## 2. Get the taste of everything

College is the best time to explore things, once college life is over your responsibilities will keep growing.

So while you are still in college, try to learn as much as you can, try to explore as many new domains, new fields, new career opportunities, new places to travel as you can.

Although this advice is valid for many scenarios, I would like to narrow it down to keep in mind that we are talking about computer science here.

### Here’s how
> # Be a jack of all trades and master of one (or a combination of few)

I think that the mindset that “if people explore a lot of things they can’t become a master of one” is outdated.

I digress, even if you become a master of “one” leaving everything else,

* Won’t it be boring?

* What will be the differentiating factor between you and the others who are skilled at it?

We can explore multiple things and still be (highly) skilled at a combination of a few, and that’s what makes the journey so exciting and makes our skills unique.

Taking my own example, I have explored a little bit of many domains/work

* Android development

* iOS development (very little though)

* Backend development

* Frontend web development

* Machine Learning

* Blockchain (Again very little)

* Blogging

* Technical content writing

* Self-help writing

* Podcasting

* Public speaking

And so on…

While exploring all these domains in college, I could clearly find a few things which worked well for me and I enjoyed them a lot, they were Frontend web development, Blogging, and public speaking,

All of this, plus a taste of my own style is what makes my skills unique, and this is how you can be “a jack of all trades and master of one (or combination of few)”

## 3. Don’t ignore the importance of DSA/Problem solving

No, don’t get me wrong, I am not asking you to be a hardcore competitive programmer, not everyone can be one, not everyone enjoys it.

Topics like Data Structures and Algorithms are the core of Computer Science, it’s completely fine if you aren’t an expert, but don’t ignore their importance.

A lot of students (including me when I was in the 2nd semester) ignore the importance of this topic and face difficulties in the final year during placements.

Even if you are not sitting for placements and want to join a startup in a particular domain (say, as a frontend developer), you never know when you might require these concepts in your work.

* College on-campus placements focus a lot on testing your problem-solving skills

* Recruitment in tech-giants also depends on your skills in this area

* Plus, having a good knowledge about data structures and algorithms can help you improve the efficiency of your code

It’s fine if you aren’t into competitive programming too much, but keep your basics clear.

### But I find it very boring, what to do?

Don’t worry, it happens with many, here are some simple steps that you can take —

 1. Understand the importance (not that it’s absolutely necessary, but it can make your life more easier)

 2. Block 1 hour in your calendar every alternate day (or every 3 days) to study

 3. During this “1 hour” make sure there are no distractions, and focus on either learning something new or practicing coding problems

Doing this can make a huge difference over a longer period of time (say, 6 months or a year). Plus, it’s not that difficult, you can easily find 1 hour to spend on this every alternate day or once in 3 days even if you are super busy.
