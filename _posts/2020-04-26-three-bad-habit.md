## “Your” time is divided into 3 zones, and so are your bad habits.

### These three habits are draining your energy and killing your productivity. STOP them now!

It’s been a couple of weeks since I wrote a blog now. Past two weeks were very busy, was working on weekdays, and was engaged in community work during the weekends.

So happy to share with you that I was invited to speak in many webinars, and the best part, the audience loved it. What more can a speaker ask, if the audience loves him?

Mostly the webinars were related to technical stuff and profile building in general, but I am planning to start an “Ask Me Anything” session every weekend. The best part, that won’t be limited to technical topics, you can feel free to ask about anything, self-help or technical, and I’ll try my best to help you out.

So yeah, if you are interested, you can subscribe to my mailing list, where I will roll out the information about the first AMA —

Alright, let’s get back to the topic now! Today I will be talking about the three things that are draining most of your energy, each day, each moment. The worst part? You are not even aware that you are losing all your energy so easily!

Don’t worry, your friend, TheLeanProgrammer is at your rescue (Yeah, I love being dramatic)!

You see, your life can be divided into three time zones according to your present moment,

 1. Your past

 2. The moment you are experiencing right now

 3. Your future

And sadly, you are continuously destroying all of it. Here are the mistakes you’ve been doing daily, and you must work on them now!

## Mistake #1: Worrying/Over-dreaming about the future

>  Hey Madhav, what’s wrong in that? Isn’t it normal to think about the future and plan accordingly?

Planning about the future and remaining in constant thoughts of the future are two different things!

<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/fH985LNdqFZXOFHygK" width="360" height="240" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/fH985LNdqFZXOFHygK">via GIPHY</a></p>

Notice your thoughts for a while, whenever you are excited, you start dreaming about a good future, whenever you are nervous, you start imagining things that can happen to you in near future, which don’t even exist!

But can you control your future? Partially yes, partially no!

You can control your present, and by controlling your present, you can build a better probability of a good future, but still we are not 100% sure. Future is just a game of probability, one can never be 100% sure about it.

My advice?

 1. Have a vision in life

 2. Have a yearly goal of what you accomplish

 3. Totally focus on next 24 hours (instead of dreaming about what will happen after a year or two)

 4. Live in the present moment, give your best each day, without thinking about the next 24 hours.

## Mistake #2: Ruminating on the past

>  Here you got me Madhav, I keep thinking about the mistakes I did in the past, it wastes a lot of my time ( ‾ ʖ̫ ‾)

You are not as much of a celebrity as you think! Everyone makes mistakes, it’s essential to learn from them and let them go.

To be honest, unless you are harming someone, silly mistakes don’t really matter, everyone makes them. Don’t be a victim to spotlight effect!

We make our own selves so important that we start thinking that everyone else is thinking about us, isn’t it? We made a small mistake in past, and we would think about it for eternities.
> # Avoid overthinking as much as possible. Stop thinking about your past, it’s gone!

The fun fact is, everyone makes mistakes, and everyone is busy thinking what would everyone else be thinking, but in reality, no one is thinking about you, you are just wasting your precious time!

> # “If you want to fly on the sky, you need to leave the earth. If you want to move forward, you need to let go the past that drags you down.” ― **Amit Ray**

## Mistake #3: Taking present for granted!

The biggest misery of life is that we don’t understand the value of the most precious and the only thing which truly belongs to us, THIS PRESENT MOMENT!

**The most precious?** Yes, you can never redeem back the moments you spend, once gone, they can never return. You can not exchange time for money, no matter how much you are ready to bid. so isn’t it the most precious thing in this world?

**The only thing that belongs to us? **Every material possession that we think we own, is for a limited amount of time. Let’s take it one step forward, (I am going to do some serious talk, don’t get bored), let’s say I give you an infinite amount of money, but that too, is for a limited time, once you die, will you be able to use that money?

I believe that the only thing that we own is our present moment, only we have the power to make a decision about it, so why not use this, yes, this present moment, to work on our dreams?

Let’s end this blog with this beautiful poem —
>  **“THE FOUR HEAVENLY FOUNTAINS”**
>  Laugh, I tell you
And you will turn back
The hands of time.
>  Smile, I tell you
And you will reflect
The face of the divine.
>  Sing, I tell you
And all the angels will sing with you!
>  Cry, I tell you
And the reflections found in your pool of tears -
Will remind you of the lessons of today and yesterday
To guide you through the fears of tomorrow.
>  ― Suzy Kassem
