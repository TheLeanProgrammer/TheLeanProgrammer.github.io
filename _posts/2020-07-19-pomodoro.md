In this contemporary world when everyone is in the rat race of achieving things the need of the hour is to create an equilibrium between the tasks at hand and the time allotted for these tasks. It is equally important to achieve all this without losing one’s calm and avoid stressful situations like burnout.

So here’s the solution for this situation, “The Pomodoro Technique”!

I’ve been following this for quite a long time now and it worked like magic for me and i strongly believe that if followed in the right manner it can create wonders for you as well.

## What actually is “Pomodoro” ?

It’s a tomato, and in this blog I will tell you to eat 10 tomatoes daily. Try it once, eat 10 tomatoes and you will become a billionare!

>  Wait, what!? Are you serious, Madhav?

Of course not, haha! I got you there! Ok, let’s get serious…

Before delving deep into how we can adapt The Pomodoro Technique in our lives and understanding how beautifully it can change the course of our lives towards becoming a more creative and productive individual without compromising with our mental peace let’s see what does “Pomodoro” actually mean.

So the technique around which this entire blog is going to revolve was developed by an entrepreneur and a software developer Francesco Cirillo.

He used a tomato shaped kitchen timer that inspired him to stay focused and productive while he was a college student and named this technique after the same timer.

Francesco found it very difficult to stay focused and to his surprise this technique not only made him focused but also relaxed while he could multitask and take care of his deadlines and at the same time give him good time for himself and activities that excited him.

This technique had a similar effect on my life and I wish I had known it before when I was a kid and struggled to manage time. But post knowing this technique, there was no looking back!

Now without any further delay let’s see how we can follow this magical secret.

## Let’s Pomodoro!

Pomodoro is nothing but the ‘time span of 25 minutes’. The way it works is petty simple. Involve yourself completely for a timed period of 25 minutes away from all distractions. Then take a 5 minutes break where do any activity you enjoy, and repeat this process :)

Now let’s go on with the step by step procedure to implement this.

### **Step 1 : Work Fragmentation**

Make a daily journal of your work that is to be accomplished. Every morning or the previous night, plan your list of work by dividing each work into smaller tasks.

Then write down the expected number of pomodoros for each task. There are 2 rules that are to be followed here :

*If a single task takes more than 4/5 pomodoros then it means it is a huge one and hence divide it into smaller tasks with fewer pomodoros.*

*Every task must have at least 1 pomodoro. If the task is too small then combine it with other tasks to get more pomodoros.*

### **Step 2 : Record The Time Using A Stopwatch/Timer**

Start each task and see whether you are able to stay focused on a single task for around 25 minutes. Use a timer for that. One simple website which allows us to do that it is — [https://pomofocus.io/](https://pomofocus.io/)

The time may vary to 35–40 minutes on the basis of your power to concentrate and work at a stretch.
>  But Madhav, what if i get an important call or it’s just a nature’s call?

Well well well, my friend, in that case, when you resume your work, you will have to restart the timer.

The essence, beauty and effectiveness of this technique is in the uninterrupted 25 mins of work you do. An interruption or distraction will make your pomodoro void. There is a very important rule in this —
>  “ A Disturbed Pomodoro Is Not A Pomodoro”

No more looking at your phone or talking to your friend in between your pomodoro time as you will have to start a fresh cycle again.

### **Step 3 : Take Proper Breaks**

Every 25 minutes of work entitles you to a 5 minute break according to this technique. This cycle of work and break helps in achieving great results.

The science behind this is the two states of mind,
1. The focused state
2. The diffused state

It is very easy to understand this. Indulge yourself completely for 25 minutes away from all interruptions. This puts your brain into **focused** state.

Take a quick 5 minutes break where you do fun activities or just let your brain wander or have a cup of green tea. This lets your brain relax and go into **diffuse** state.

Repeat this cycle for 4 times and then take a longer break of say 15–30 minutes.

## **Step 4 : Plan, Record And Tally**

As described earlier we have to pre-plan our tasks and designate pomodoros.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*uQ4lgNZ2DCCF2Eo9.png)

Make a daily journal, write the list of tasks, and the expected number of pomodoros to finish it. Once you complete 1 pomodoro, mark a cross in front of the task.

At the completion of each day tally the actual pomodoros (crossed ones) we needed and contrast it to the ones we planned.

If they don’t match then we must understand the reasons of the mismatch. Say for example you planned two pomodoros but took 3 actually for a task then put a cross against the two planned ones which are enclosed in a box. And then add a cross without a box for the 3rd extra unplanned one which was needed.
>  Boxes Are Made For The Pomodoro That Was Planned. Extra crosses are added without box.

It may be the distractions that made us lag in our tasks or it could be the overestimation or underestimation of the tasks at hand. After knowing the reasons we must always take steps to improve our planning in future.

### **Step 5 : Aim For Exponential Growth**

At the start it is very difficult to achieve 25 minutes of 0 distractions. To be honest when I started I could only go upto 1 pomodoro.

But with time it becomes a great habit and soon you can see the results for your own self.

Make sure that you aim to achieve equal or greater than the pomodoros of the previous day. Also list down the distractions you faced and how you can get rid of them with time.

## How Does It Help?

There are various reasons why one must use this technique and there are plenty of ways in which it is extremely helpful. Few of them are :

 1. Enhances Focus : This technique requires 25 minutes of complete focus and dedication while executing a task. It thus enhances concentration.

 2. Helps To Navigate Into Difficult Tasks : When a single task has been broken down into several small tasks then it seems achievable. Thus in the long run it helps delving deep and finalizing seemingly difficult tasks.

 3. Improves Your Decision Making : This method requires proper planning and partitioning of our time. Time Management requires good and proper distribution that is facilitated by organisation and involves making decisions. Thus we decide on things that are more important and need majority of our attention and energy. This, in the long run makes decision making both easier and more effective.

 4. Reduces The Interruptions And Distractions : In this era we have become addicted to a lot of crap or i should say we have become slaves to many distractions. We often are habitual to checking social media handles or looking at our phones for notifications quite often and even while we are working. This technique requires dedication, discipline and strong will power. You may fail at the start (like I did) but with time you will start mastering it and you can see how in a few days all your distractions may seem to fade away.

 5. Makes You Focused Towards Your Goals : Your Goals will be the driving force that will make you follow this technique. Once you start following Pomodoro method from my personal experience I can tell you, you will be able to see that you are already walking determined and undeterred towards the achievement of your long term goals in life. It is this realization that shall be the driving force pushing you further into following it for a lifetime.

So that is the end of this blog. We learnt how we can make use of The Pomodoro Technique to strike a balance between focused work with relaxed mind enabling us to work towards achieving our goals and fulfilling our responsibilities.
