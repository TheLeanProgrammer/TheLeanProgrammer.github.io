### This valentine’s day, gift your partner a better relationship by making these 3 promises.

Just to clarify things, if you are thinking I am a *Relationship Guru* to write such a blog, no I am not. In fact, I was a failure at maintaining relationships.

When I talk about relationships, I don’t always mean a romantic relationship. Just look around yourself, you’ll find love everywhere, love in the parent-child relationship, friendships, love between siblings, your love for animals, your love for your work, your love for the things you enjoy doing, there’s love within you, and outside you.

> If I could be irrational, and not a science student, (and if I did not know about atoms), I would definitely say that this world is made of Love!

Looking back 6-7 years, I’ve seen many friends go away from me, I started keeping everyone at a distance, and in short, I was miserable. But it was after my heartbreak that I came to know the reasons for my misery, and trust me, it’s actually simple to maintain any relationship if you follow these 3 things which I will tell you.

Yeah, this advice does not come from my expertise, but it comes from my experiences. And trust me, it’s applicable not only to the “romantic relationships” but in any relationship out there, friendships, siblings, parent-child…

## The Three Promises

> I promise you that once you implement these 3 things in your relation, things will be better, independent of which relation you implement them on, it’s as much valid on normal friendships as it is valid on romantic relationships. But, it will work only if you follow these promises religiously.

## Promise #1: Truthfulness
>  **Never telling a lie, NO MATTER WHAT!**

Trust is an essential element in any relationship, once it’s gone, it’s very difficult to gain it back at the same level.

The essence of any relationship is trust, in case of romantic relationships, two people come together with a feeling of mutual understanding and a promise to stay together no matter what.

That’s the fundamental level of trust. Over a period of time, trust becomes stronger, and the two people start trusting each other with everything, even with the smallest things that happen in their daily life.

Now if a person tells a lie, even if it’s about a very insignificant thing, trust starts to break. The sad truth about trust is that its regeneration rate is very slow.

>  I can say that it takes months to gain someone’s trust, less than a second to break it and years to rebuild it.

So no matter what, tell the truth.

Mistakes happen, people do mess up, but we should not forget that no one is perfect, and relationships are all about accepting the flaws in the other person, highlighting their qualities, and helping them improve on their flaws. If you think like that, you will realize that there is never a need to tell a lie, because if it’s true love, your partner will understand you even if you made a mistake and help you improve.

## Promise #2: Proper Communication
>  **Never hide anything, try to share even the smallest details of your day, and be clear with what you say. Don’t be manipulative with words.**

Any relationship demands time, and proper communication. It’s a fact that the things happening to us are a result of our own actions, directly or indirectly.

How we behave with others will determine what behavior we get back in return. It’s applicable in everything, there is nothing such as “anything for nothing” in this world.

To gain trust, we have to give trust. 
To earn respect, we have to show respect.

And as I told above, trust is the essence of any relationship. But to build trust, two people must know each other first, and to do that, spending time with each other, sharing small things with each other, is very important.

## Promise #3: Loyalty
>  **KNOWING YOUR LIMITS**

This is THE MOST important promise which you must give to your partner, and follow it religiously.

The above 2 promises, if broken, won’t bring disastrous effects suddenly. But, if you fail at this promise, if you fail at staying loyal, if you cheat on your partner, trust will be crushed, and that amount of trust will never come back.

Loyalty means knowing your limits in every situation.

Never think that commitment means the lack of freedom. Love brings freedom, and it also makes you realize the fundamental mistakes you have been doing. There is a limit to everything, no matter what you do, and love makes you realize of these healthy limits.

When it comes to relationships, I do agree that things are sensitive. So a simple solution to tackle this situation is to ask yourself this one simple question every time you do something.

>  How would I react, how would I feel if he/she did the same thing?

This question will never let go wrong!
