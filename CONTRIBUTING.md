# Submitting Contributionsüë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª  
Below you will find the process and workflow used to review and merge your changes.  

## Step 0 : Find an issue  üîç
- Take a look at the Existing Issues or create your **own** Issues!  
- Wait for the Issue to be assigned to you after which you can start working on it.  
- Note : Every change in this project should/must have an associated issue.   
![issue](https://github.com/TheLeanProgrammer/TheLeanProgrammer.github.io/issues)  
  
## Step 1 : Fork the Project üç¥
- Fork this Repository. This will create a Local Copy of this Repository on your Github Profile. Keep a reference to the original project in `upstream` remote.  
```  
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Community-Website  
$ cd <repo-name>  
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/TheLeanProgrammer/TheLeanProgrammer
```  
![fork](git@github.com:TheLeanProgrammer/TheLeanProgrammer.github.io.git)  
  
- Update your forked repo before working.  
```  
$ git remote update  
$ git checkout <branch-name>  
$ git rebase upstream/<branch-name>  
```  
## Step 2 : Branch  üîñ
Create a new branch. Use its name to identify the issue you are addressing.  
```  
# It will create a new branch with name Branch_Name and switch to that branch 
$ git checkout -b branch_name  
```  

## Step 3 : Commit  
- To commit give a descriptive message for the convenience of reviewer by:  
```
# This message get associated with all files you have changed  
$ git commit -m "message"  
```

### Commit message guidelines
- Each commit message consists of a header, a body and a footer. The header has a special format that includes a type, a scope and a subject:
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```
Any line of the commit message cannot be longer than 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools
